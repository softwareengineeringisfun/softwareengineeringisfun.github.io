                        Developing successful complex systems requires software engineering disciplines. One of the software engineering disciplines is the software architecture of a system. Often systems are redesigned, not because of the functionality but because they are too slow, hard to maintain, or hard to scale. From a business perspective, it is crucial that these challenges are systematically addressed early in the process to avoid economic losses in the long perspective. 
                        These challenges mentioned above are, among others, what software architecture is concerned with. 
                        Incorporating effective practices to design software architectures is essential to create a successful software system.

                    <p class="mt-3">
                        The founder of Software Engineering is Sune Chung Jepsen.
                        He has nearly 10 years of experience in the private sector, working on smaller and larger software projects before working in academia. Currently, he works as a research assistant at the SDU Software Engineering Section at the University of Southern Denmark. His research interest lies within the areas 1) software architectures for specific types of systems, 2) software architectures for emerging technologies, and 3) organization processes and software architecture strategies. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="mt-3">
                        He completed his PhD 2022 at the SDU Software Engineering Section at the University of Southern Denmark. His doctoral project aims to investigate software architectures for production systems in relation to Industry 4.0. The research includes architecture evaluation, functional and non-functional requirements for infrastructure platforms that support smart manufacturing systems, as well as implementing and evaluating actual middleware for the systems. Software architecture and non-functional requirements are the main focus in order to facilitate the integration of smart production in the I4.0 Laboratory and companies.
